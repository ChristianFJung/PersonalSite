<p> I'm a  second year student studying computer science at the University of Virginia, interested in the intersection of data and people. I currently teach an introductory data science class at <a href="https://hackcville.com/course/node/">HackCville</a> and have joined clubs that have allowed me to explore computer science in an interdisciplinary fashion. This diversity will allow me to be cognizant of biases when I develop algorithms and analyze data.  </p>

<p> On a personal note, I'm the oldest of 4 siblings, I love to run, scuba dive, and volunteer with children in STEM! </p>
